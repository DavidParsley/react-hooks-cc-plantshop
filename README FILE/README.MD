# Plantsy - React Plant Store

# Overview

Plantsy is a plant store web application built with React. It allows users to manage a collection of plants, add new ones, update their prices, mark them as "sold out," and search through the available plants. The app communicates with a backend API to persist the data, and the admin interface provides an easy-to-use platform for managing plant listings.
